# apss2bids
Convert APSS file data structure to BIDS standard

### Setting up the new dataset folder
In the same folder where the original dataset is located, create a new dataset 
folder, e.g. APSS-BIDS. In the new dataset folder, create then three subfolders:
code, input and derivatives. In the folder code, clone this repository.

```mkdir APSS-BIDS
cd APSS-BIDS
mkdir code input derivatives
cd code
git clone 
```
